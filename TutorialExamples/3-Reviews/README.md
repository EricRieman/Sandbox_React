for this project, we need to install react icons:
    npm install react-icons

react-icons have a whole bunch of icons to choose from, check
them out!

https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons

these icons are imported as react componeents, and we can style them
useing css. for example font-size and color can be set to change size/color of the icon.
